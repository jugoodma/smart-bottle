# smart-bottle

i wanna make a "smart" water bottle

goals:
* learn more about hardware
* make something functional
* have it wireless/portable
* write all of the code, including a companion android app
* have the app/code not look like dogsh!t
* comparable to a real smart bottle ($60 [eg](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RM7XXNS/)) (ideally <$100 total build)

## materials

* ($10) [raspberry pi zero w](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3400)
* ($40) [water level sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/464)
* ($15) [9-dof orientation sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4517)
* ($) [rechargable battery]() (maybe find one with wireless charging?)
* (<$20) [water bottle](https://www.amazon.com/50-Strong-Sports-Squeeze-Bottles/dp/B079ZZYV4L/)
* ($8) [tape](https://www.amazon.com/10-Acrylic-Adhesive-Waterproof-Removable-Mounting/dp/B07Z1WPB77)

ideally your bottle is a soft plastic (squeeze-able) to make it easy to drill into.

could potentially cut down costs by replacing water level sensor with a few floating sensors (continuous vs discrete).
could also look at aliexpress for knock-offs.
can potentially substitute tape for glue.

we could also use an optical/sonar sensor in the cap ([eg](https://trago.co/pages/trago-cap)) instead of a side-mounted water resistor.
* ([eg](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-waterproof%20ultrasonic%20sensor.html), [eg](https://www.amazon.com/diymore-Waterproof-Ultrasonic-Measuring-Transducer/dp/B01J5KZU8M)) -- only issue with this is accuracy

will also need misc parts:

* a way to connect with the pi
* soldering tools
* wiring
* a drill
* probably hot glue, or some hole sealant
* maybe screws, maybe some wood

## method

1. put level sensor inside bottle
1. write code
1. profit
